# Portfolio Piece - Analyzing User Behavior Based on Mobile Device Usage
This is a dataset based on the analysis of mobile device usage patterns and user-behavior. This is my first ever portfolio project and I had a great time trialing and error through some of the queries to get the result I wanted.                           
<sub>so go easy on me ;) </sub>

## Project Scope
**Tech used:** Excel, SQL(PostgreSQL), PowerBI
This project required a small amount of manipulation in excel, DDL and DML in SQL. 

## Dataset
This dataset was found while browsing around on Kaggle, titled, "Mobile Device Usage and User Behavior Dataset
" by Vala Khorasani [It can be found here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/valakhorasani/mobile-device-usage-and-user-behavior-dataset)

## Lessons Learned:
Prior to this, I have had little experience with typing queries such as these. I found CASE to be extremely useful when making buckets for ages in some of the queries. Another key-knowledge point for this project was seperating the queries into more "business jargon" 
If you wander over to the .sql file in this repo, you'll notice that there are sections to the queries. This is to seperate the queries to different metrics a company or person may be looking to view from this data. Some include 'Performance Metrics' 'Behavioral Insights' and 'Device and OS Trends'
